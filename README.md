    Assign roles: In Sarafu, you can assign different roles to each user in the joint account, such as "primary user" or "secondary user." This helps to clarify each user's responsibilities and access levels.
    Set objectives: With Sarafu, you can also set objectives for your joint account, such as saving a specific amount of money or making a certain number of transactions. The joint account will only allow transactions to take place when the objectives are met.
    Monitor activity: Finally, Sarafu allows you to monitor the activity of your joint account, so you can keep track of transactions, balances, and progress towards objectives.

By using Sarafu's joint account feature, users can collaborate and manage their finances together, without the need for a traditional bank account.
