Sarafu is designed to be easy to use for both buyers and sellers. Here are the steps to follow:
For Sellers

    Create an objective: In Sarafu, you can create an objective by assigning a specific amount of currency to it. This ensures that the transaction only takes place when the objective is met.
    Publish the objective: Once you have created the objective, you can publish it on the Sarafu platform for others to see.
    Wait for buyers: After publishing the objective, you can wait for buyers to purchase it. The transaction will only take place when the objective is met.

For Buyers

    Browse objectives: On the Sarafu platform, you can browse available objectives and choose the one that best suits your needs.
    Purchase the objective: Once you have chosen an objective, you can purchase it by sending the required amount of currency. The transaction will only take place when the objective is met.

Sarafu allows users to create online joint accounts, which can be used for shared financial goals or expenses. Here's how it works:

    Create a joint account: To create a joint account, you need to invite another user to join your account. Once they accept the invitation, you can both access the joint account and perform transactions.
    Assign roles: In Sarafu, you can assign different roles to each user in the joint account, such as "primary user" or "secondary user." This helps to clarify each user's responsibilities and access levels.
    Set objectives: With Sarafu, you can also set objectives for your joint account, such as saving a specific amount of money or making a certain number of transactions. The joint account will only allow transactions to take place when the objectives are met.
    Monitor activity: Finally, Sarafu allows you to monitor the activity of your joint account, so you can keep track of transactions, balances, and progress towards objectives.

By using Sarafu's joint account feature, users can collaborate and manage their finances together, without the need for a traditional bank account.
